  
# Breeding Across Isolated Populations of Skyros Lizards

  

## Biological Question

How does distance between island populations impact the potential for speciation in Skyros lizards?

  

  

  

## Context

Isolation has been known to promote more rapid phenotypic evolution in island populations than mainland populations (Case 1978, 1-2). The separation of small populations leads to increased genetic drift and for terrestrial species, the ocean acts as a firm border initiating the potential for allopatric speciation (speciation caused by geographic isolation). This is often referred to as the theory of island speciation.

Dr. Anna Runemark with Lund University has published several papers on the lizards of Skyros, Greece (Runemark et al. 2011; Runemark and Svensson 2012; Runemark et al. 2015). This system of islands forms a mainland-island system and can be used to study the potential for allopatric speciation. Skyros is a large island off the coast of Greece, surrounded by several other small islands. This system acts as a miniaturized model for the island speciation theory. The Skyros lizards are distributed across the main island ("mainland") and across many smaller nearby islands ("islets"). Across Runemark’s studies the locations of lizard specimens were considered categorical data, but by examining them as a continuous numerical distance variable, we can begin to understand how the geographic separation of these populations affect the behavioral and pheromonal compatibility across this distance gradient. This analysis will help inform our understanding of speciation.

  

  

  

## Methods

  

#### Sources of the Data

These experiments were performed by collecting individuals from one of four locations around Spyros (2 mainland, 2 islet). Then individuals were subjected to breeding compatibility or scent preference in a lab environment.

  

##### Breeding Data

Svensson. 2012. “Sexual selection as a promoter of population divergence in male phenotypic characters: a study on mainland and islet lizard populations.” _Biological Journal of the Linnean Society_ 106, no. 2: 374-389. [https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.01866.x](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.01866.x)

Breeding preference was measured over an hour to see how frequently a pair would copulate successfully. Lizards were placed in a gridded environment and their time spent in proximity and apart from each other were measured. When the male and female interacted there attempt at breeding was either categorized as a “success” or an “escape”.

  

  

##### Pheromonal Data

"Population divergence in chemical signals and the potential for premating isolation between islet‐and mainland populations of the Skyros wall lizard (_Podarcis gaigeae_)." _Journal of Evolutionary Biology_ 24, no. 4 (2011): 795-809. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02214.x

Scent recognition and preference were identified by seeing how often an individual would lick a sample of another individual's scent. Males and females were only subjected to the scent of the opposite gender. A non gendered and gendered control were established by using a closely related species but who the lizards would theoretically have no interest mating with.

  

  

#### Goals of the Original Studies

I am using data from two number of Runemark's papers. There were several original goals for this breadth of data. The primary data set that I am using to understand the ultimate breeding capacity between individuals from different locations was originally used to determine how male throat morphology (variety in coloration and snout size) impacts sexual selection. I also incorporated data from a study which examined if mate scent preference impacted pre-mating isolation (non-breeding populations separated not by genetics or organ morphology but by behavioral or other means). The original use of the pheromonal data was just to determine whether islet individuals preferred other islet scents (and vice verse for mainland).

  

#### My Interpretation of the Data

The main differentiation between my analysis of the data and theirs was that I calculated site distances (from provided GPS coordinates) and treated the collection site distance between pairs as a continuous variable. This was then used to determine linear models to describe how these populations exhibit the indicators of speciation across the distance gradient. Additionally, when examining the pheromonal data, I did so by first incorporating the data from the non gendered data which Runemark et al. did not do.

  

  

## Results and Conclusions

I found a clear linear trend describing that breeding success likelihood decreases with distance. The ratio of successful breeding events to failures decreases by .0156 for each km. Breeding success likelihood of a pair decreases with distance between their origin sites (p = 0.02151). Green shaded region represents 95% confidence intervals in linear model.

I also found that pre-mating isolation potential increases with distance. Females showed a decrease of 3.4 licks per km of distance while male interest seemed to be unaffected by site distance. Sexual interest was indicated by how often a pheromone sample was licked by a member of the opposite sex (Females: p = 0.00011). Values are corrected against an ungendered control (black line). Shaded regions represents 95% confidence intervals in linear model. The black line represents the ungendered control value and its standard deviation which the values for each gender were normalized against.

  
#### Future Directions
I will continue working with the slopes of these linear models to create an interactive graph which can help teach speciation in classes.

## Appendix

  

Extra figure: Ungendered linear regression for the pheromonal experiment. The p value was 0.0028, meaning all of the regression calculated in the gendered analysis is from the females. This concurs with the results seen in the gendered graph.
