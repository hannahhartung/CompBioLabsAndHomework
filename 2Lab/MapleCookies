Ingredients

1 cup butter, at room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt

Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with a baking mat or parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, maple syrup, and vanilla. Stir until well combined. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix to combine.
3. The dough should be a little bit stiffer than a traditional chocolate chip cookie dough recipe. You made need to add and up to an additional 1/4 cup of flour to achieve this. The dough should not be tacky to the touch. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
4. Remove the dough from the fridge and divide into 4 pieces. Roll one piece out on a lightly floured surface until the dough is 1/4 of an inch thick. Cut the dough with cookie cutters and place on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes until the edges start to turn golden brown and the centers a set. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 3-5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to finish cooling.
5. Enjoy with a cold glass of milk and store any extras in an air-tight container.
